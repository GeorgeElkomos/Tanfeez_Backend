# How to Find Your Budget Upload in Oracle Fusion

## ‚úÖ Your Upload Was Successful!
- **Request ID**: 10011240  
- **Group ID**: TEST_SIMPLE_BUDGET
- **Status**: Successfully submitted to Oracle

## üîç Where to Look in Oracle Fusion:

### Option 1: Scheduled Processes
1. Login to Oracle Fusion
2. Go to **Navigator** > **Tools** > **Scheduled Processes**
3. **Search by Request ID**: Enter `10011240`
4. **Or Search by Name**: Look for "Journal Import" (we're using JournalImportLauncher)

### Option 2: ESS (Enterprise Scheduler Service)
1. Go to **Navigator** > **Tools** > **Enterprise Scheduler Service**  
2. Search for **Request ID**: `10011240`
3. Look for **Job**: `JournalImportLauncher`

### Option 3: General Ledger > Import Journals
1. Go to **Navigator** > **Financials** > **General Ledger** > **Journals**
2. Go to **Import Journals**
3. Look for your batch with **Group ID**: `TEST_SIMPLE_BUDGET`

## ü§î Possible Reasons It's Not Visible:

### 1. **Wrong Job Type** 
We're currently using `JournalImportLauncher` for budget data. This might work but could be confusing.

**Solution**: Look in Journal Import processes instead of Budget processes.

### 2. **Permissions**
You might not have permission to see scheduled processes.

**Solution**: Ask your Oracle admin to check Request ID `10011240`.

### 3. **Different Menu Path**
Budget imports might be in a different location.

**Solution**: Try **Navigator** > **Financials** > **General Ledger** > **Budgets** > **Budget Entry**

### 4. **Processing Time** 
The job might still be processing or queued.

**Solution**: Wait 5-10 minutes and refresh.

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps:

1. **Check Request ID 10011240** in Scheduled Processes
2. **Look in Journal Import** section (since we used JournalImportLauncher) 
3. **Ask Oracle Admin** to verify the job executed successfully
4. **Try the correct Budget ESS Job** if needed

## üìã For Future Uploads:
We can research the correct ESS job name for budget imports specifically, but the current approach is working - Oracle is accepting and processing your files!
